  npm run test:e2e
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design & Architecture

### Component Structure

- **`App`**: Top-level state, theme toggle, navigation between `<StoryList>` and `<StoryViewer>` (or `<PunScreen>`).
- **`StoryList`**: Displays thumbnails and handles file uploads.
- **`StoryViewer`**: Full-screen story viewer with progress bar, manual & auto-advance.
- **`PunScreen`**: Lightweight "joke" overlay when you upload (with a "hire me" call-to-action).

### Performance Optimizations

- **`useMemo`** for sorting stories so we only recompute when the underlying data changes.
- **`useCallback`** to stabilize handler references and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Vite** for lightning-fast hot module replacement and lean production bundles (via Rollup under the hood).
- **SessionStorage** for minimal persistence‚Äîno heavy client-side database or global state library.

### Scalability Considerations

- **Modular components**: each feature lives in its own file under `src/components`, easy to maintain or extract.
- **Configurable durations**: test hooks override timing via `window.__STORY_DURATION`, so adding new animations or story behaviors remains testable.
- **Decoupled styling**: CSS per-component and CSS variables for theming allow easy design updates or brand changes.
- **E2E coverage** with Playwright ensures that as new features (e.g. comments, reactions) are added, regressions are caught early.
